# Alonzo-testnet
This is the repository for the Alonzo testnet rollout program.

Here you will find [exercises](https://github.com/input-output-hk/Alonzo-testnet/tree/main/Alonzo-exercises) to use on the Alonzo testnet. We will gradually add materials to this repository through the testnet phases to help you understand the testnet and make use of its features.

Note that to ensure a good user experience we will be rolling the testnets out in phases. At this point in time, we are restricting access to a few invited users. If you are not one of those users, please bear with us until we are ready to open up for general access.
